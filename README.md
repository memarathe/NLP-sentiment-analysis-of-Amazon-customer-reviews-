# NLP-sentiment-analysis-of-Amazon-customer-reviews-
Sentiment analysis of Amazon product reviews involves analyzing customer feedback to determine the underlying sentimentâ€”whether the review is positive, negative, or neutral. This process helps businesses and consumers understand the general opinion about a product based on user-generated content.

The input text files contain sentences labelled with positive or negative sentiment, extracted from reviews of products, movies, and restaurants

The sentences come from three different websites/fields:

imdb.com
amazon.com
yelp.com

For each website, there exist 500 positive and 500 negative sentences. Those were selected randomly for larger datasets of reviews. 
We attempted to select sentences that have a clearly positive or negative connotaton, the goal was for no neutral sentences to be selected.
